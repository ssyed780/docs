description: "Get API Authorization Token The CRM API utilizes bearer token authentication to ensure secure access to its features and data. This section explains the authentication and authorization schemes used in the CRM API. Overview of Bearer Token Authentication Bearer token authentication is a widely adopted authentication scheme that involves the use of a token, typically an access token or refresh token, to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources. In this implementation, the access token is created using credentials generated from within the CRM. Authentication Flow The following steps outline the authentication flow for the CRM API: Client Registration: The client (e.g., a mobile app or web application) registers with the CRM platform by providing its client ID and redirect URI. Authorization Request: The client redirects the user to the CRM authorization server, where they are prompted to log in and authorize access to their CRM data. Authorization Code: After successful authentication, the CRM authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code. Token Exchange: The client exchanges the authorization code for a bearer token (access token) by sending a POST request to the CRM token endpoint. Bearer Token Storage: The client stores the obtained bearer token securely and includes it in subsequent requests to the CRM API. Authorization Schemes The CRM API uses the following authorization schemes: 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) The CRM API implements RBAC, which grants access to specific features and data based on a user's role within the organization. Roles are defined as follows: Admin: Full access to all features and data. User: Limited access to their own contact information and sales history. Manager: Access to their team's contact information and sales history, with limited ability to edit. 2. Feature-Based Access Control (FBAC) The CRM API also implements FBAC, which grants access to specific features based on the user's permissions. Features are categorized as follows: Contact Management: Create, read, update, and delete contacts. Sales History: View sales history for their own contacts. Reporting: Generate reports on sales performance. Authentication and Authorization Endpoints The following endpoints are used to authenticate and authorize access to the CRM API: 1) Generate a token from the CRM admin tab 2)Use the Get API Auth token endpoint to get an access token 3)Use the token in your bearer token auth value Best Practices for Authentication and Authorization  To ensure secure authentication and authorization, follow these best practices: Store bearer tokens securely using a secure storage mechanism. Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Implement rate limiting and IP blocking to prevent brute-force attacks. Regularly review and update access controls to ensure they remain effective. By following this documentation, developers can understand the authentication and authorization schemes used in the CRM API and implement secure access to its features and data Receive an API Authorization Token. The Token that is returned can be entered for any API Request that requires an Api-Key. "
